# Software package for external heart assist device actuation with Maxon EPOS2

For heart assist device experiments at the Institute of Fluid Dynamics, both a Maxon controller and a Maxon electric motor are employed. The motor drives a gear, which again drives as spindle that translates rotary motion into linear motion. Between the heart assisting patches moving toward each other and the spindle a Bowden cable used. This system allows for a lean patch design and can easily be wrapped around the heart. The Maxon controller is operated through this package.

## Prerequisites

For compiling this package, the EPOS-Linux-Library has to be installed.
